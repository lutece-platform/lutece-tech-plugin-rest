                  Lutece is a portal engine which allows you to easily create your websites or intranets based upon HTML,XML.. content. 
                  This open-source software is implemented in Java and based on Apache Software Foundation projects (i.e. Jakarta and XML projects).
                  Lutece provides a user friendly interface for portal management and therefore no specific technical skills are required.
